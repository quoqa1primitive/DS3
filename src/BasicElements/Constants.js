Food Consumption Pattern?

`
export const text2 = `The monthly chart shows in detail that the increasing trends were distinct. While X's food consumption increased noticeably after May, Y's went up steadily.
`
export const text3 = `However, the vegetable and grain consumption timeline revealed the contrasting patterns of the two cities.
`
export const text4 = `In the early of 2021, the ratio of vegetable and grain consumption in both cities were comparable.
`
export const text5 = `Y's ratio has exceeded X's since May. The gap between the two cities kept increasing until the end of 2021.
`
export const text6 = `In sum, urbanization appeared to affect both the total and composition of consumption. However, there was no direct causal relationship with the type of consumption pattern.

export const text2_1 = `The yield curve shows how much it costs the federal government to borrow money for a given amount of time, revealing the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates.

It is, inherently, a forecast for what the economy holds in the future — how much inflation there will be, for example, and how healthy growth will be over the years ahead — all embodied in the price of money today, tomorrow and many years from now.
`

export const text2_2 = `On Wednesday, both short-term and long-term rates were lower than they have been for most of history – a reflection of the continuing hangover from the financial crisis.

The yield curve is fairly flat, which is a sign that investors expect mediocre growth in the years ahead.
`

export const text2_3 =`In response to the last recession, the Federal Reserve has kept short-term rates very low — near zero — since 2008. (Lower interest rates stimulate the economy, by making it cheaper for people to borrow money, but also spark inflation.)

Now, the Fed is getting ready to raise rates again, possibly as early as June.
`

export const text2_4 =`The last time the Fed started raising rates was in 2004. From 2004 to 2006, short-term rates rose steadily.

But long-term rates didn't rise very much.

The Federal Reserve chairman called this phenomenon a “conundrum," and it raised questions about the ability of the Fed to guide the economy.

Part of the reason long-term rates failed to rise was because of strong foreign demand
`

export const text2_5=`Foreign buyers have helped keep long-term rates low recently, too — as have new rules encouraging banks to hold government debt and expectations that economic growth could be weak for a long time.

The 10-year Treasury yield was as low as it has ever been in July 2012 and has risen only modestly since.

Some economists refer to the economic pessimism as “the new normal.”
